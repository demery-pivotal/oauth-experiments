    # Groups act as permissions. To give a user a permission, add the user to
    # the group that defines the permission. In the Authorization Code flow (and
    # perhaps other flows), UAA presents a page that displays the description of
    # each requested permission as a checkbox, which allows the user to select
    # which permissions to grant.

  users:
    # The format is: username|password|comma-separated-group-names
    # The list of groups is essentially the user's list of permissions. When UAA
    # requests permissions from a user, it presents only the permissions listed
    # here.
